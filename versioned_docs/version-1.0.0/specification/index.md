# Overview

The ArchDoc Specification attempts to define a standardized and easy-to-read format for describing the components and users of a software system. It allows developers, architects, and other stakeholders to easily define the various components of a software system and their relationships, as well as any additional information like code repoistory, tags, documentation, etc.

The ArchDoc Specification is open-source and owned by the community in order that other diagramming and modeling tools can visualize ArchDoc models.
