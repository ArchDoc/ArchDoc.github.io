Welcome! The ArchDoc project has just released the launch of the first official version of the ArchDoc Specification.

The purpose of the ArchDoc project is to define a common, standardized specification to describe software architectures.

## Diagram-as-code

In recent years, diagram-as-code tools have been gaining popularity. These tools allow users to quickly generate technical diagrams. More recently, a new suite of diagram-as-code tools amerged. Instead of providing a way to use code to directly generate diagrams, you use an editor to define a model of your software system. From these models, these tools can generate diagrams and visualizations, depending on what the user is intrested in. Some examples of these tools are:
 - [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/)
 - [Illograph](https://www.ilograph.com/)
 - [Ice Panel](https://icepanel.io/)
 - [Carbide](https://carbide.dev/)

## Why ArchDoc?

So, then why choose ArchDoc?

I believe in creating a completely open-source way to model software systems. Instead of locking an organization into using a specific web editor tool and charging licenses, ArchDoc allows anyone to model a system architecture for free.

The goal is to make the ArchDoc Specification a community-driven standard that can be ammended and udpated as needed. This allows both open-source and closed-source tools to build tooling to support it.

## Final Words

I understand that ArchDoc is still a young project, but I am hopeful that the community will grow and help define a standardized way of modeling large, enterprise-level software systems. Please consider joining this effort!
