The ArchDoc project has just released the launch of the first official version of the ArchDoc Specification.\\n\\nThe purpose of the ArchDoc project is to define a common, standardized specification to describe software architectures.\\n\\n## Diagram-as-code\\n\\nIn recent years, diagram-as-code tools have been gaining popularity. These tools allow users to quickly generate technical diagrams. More recently, a new suite of diagram-as-code tools amerged. Instead of providing a way to use code to directly generate diagrams, you use an editor to define a model of your software system. From these models, these tools can generate diagrams and visualizations, depending on what the user is intrested in. Some examples of these tools are:\\n - [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/)\\n - [Illograph](https://www.ilograph.com/)\\n - [Ice Panel](https://icepanel.io/)\\n - [Carbide](https://carbide.dev/)\\n\\n## Why ArchDoc?\\n\\nSo, then why choose ArchDoc?\\n\\nI believe in creating a completely open-source way to model software systems. Instead of locking an organization into using a specific web editor tool and charging licenses, ArchDoc allows anyone to model a system architecture for free.\\n\\nThe goal is to make the ArchDoc Specification a community-driven standard that can be ammended and udpated as needed. This allows both open-source and closed-source tools to build tooling to support it.\\n\\n## Final Words\\n\\nI understand that ArchDoc is still a young project, but I am hopeful that the community will grow and help define a standardized way of modeling large, enterprise-level software systems. Please consider joining this effort!"}]}')}}]);
